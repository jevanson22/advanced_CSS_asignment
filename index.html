                 sourced from various wastes, I'm likely to be exploring new (to me) highways of the Pacific Northwest on my motorcycle,
                or relaxing on a body of water trying to navigate the thin line between fishing and sitting there looking stupid. When/if I ever 
                get a photo of me that looks remotely professional, I'll offset it to the left with an anchor tag to my contact info.
